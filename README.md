This repository is the codes for the article "Towards Delay-Based Utility Maximization: Modeling and Implementation in SDWN Platform". 
We categorize these codes into six catalogs: "Codes run on the controller", "Cross_layer network states sampling modules", "Results analysis", "Simulation_codes", and "TCP information get". We introduce these codes individually.
Firstly, we should introduce our SDWN platform first.
